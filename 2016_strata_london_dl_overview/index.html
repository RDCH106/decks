# Agenda

.middlebelowheader[

### Learning Representations via Context Predictions

### Learning Agent Control with Trajectory Optimization

]

---
# Deep Learning is very successful...

.middlebelowheader[

when labeled data is both **rich** and **abundant**:

- object classification for 1000 classes and 1M images

- speech recognition with thousands of hours of time aligned audio transcriptions

]

# What to do when labels are lacking?

.middlebelowheader[

### Traditional unsupervised learning

#### Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

### Reconstruction through bottleneck/noise

#### Auto-encoders, Ladder Networks

### Generative models

#### Probabilistic Models P(X), Generative Adversarial Networks

# Learning Agent Control with Trajectory Optimization

# Agent Control


.middlebelowheader[

## Optimal Control / Planning

### Requires accurate model and comprehensive state features

### Trajectory optimization too compute intensive for real-time

]

---
# Deep Reinforcement Learning


.middlebelowheader[

### Agent policy parametrized by a deep network

### Quite successful for Atari Games and AlphaGo

### Collecting a lot of training via (self-)play

### Bootstrapped by supervised learning (AlphaGo)

### How to collect similar experience for agent control?

]

---
# Reinforcement Learning from sensory input

### Delayed reward 'too small' for high dim state / observations

### Learning to walk will never see positive reward from random policy init

### How to collect experience or even supervised labels?
